## Description
For this assignment, I worked with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine. I was supposed to change code that was provided from using REST APIs to GraphQL with Apollo Server. In order to do so, I had to change the “server.js” file to set-up the Apollo Server. On the server side, I then had to create the resolvers and typeDefs files in the schemas folder and use them to replace the files in the previous api and controllers folder. On the client side, I had to create the “mutations” and “queries” files in the utils folder. I was not able to deploy to Heroku because it is not working for me, as well as, many of my classmates tonight.

## Installation
For my app, you need to have React, MongoDB, Mongoose, GraphQL, node.js, and express.js.
